The problem confused me since it was already solved in the excercises?!

I recoded the solution from the excercises from scratch and also came up with my own solution which does
not use a pivot strategy (and therefore likely misses the point of the problem), because I wasn't sure
what else to do here? 


My own solution takes takes a single traversal, but has to store the number of zeros, ones and twos and
has to use extend which might use more space than the pivot solution. I am looking forward to your feedback.
Time complexity is O(n) since I am traversing once. Space complexity is O(n) since I am creating a new array. 


The solution inspired (but almost identical) to the ones in the excercise exhibit time complexity of O(n) as well
but space complexity of O(1) (assuming you don't count the input!).
