The problem confused me since it was already solved in the excercises?!

My own solution takes takes a single traversal, but has to store the number of zeros, ones and twos and
has to use extend which might use more space than the pivot solution. I am looking forward to your feedback.
Time complexity is O(n) since I am traversing once. Space complexity is O(n) since I am creating a new array. 

I believe my own solution performs a little worse in space complexity (I have to  create a second array), but since
I came up with my own solution instead of just copying the solution from th excercises, I chose to submit my own solution.
