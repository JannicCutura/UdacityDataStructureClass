My solution builds on the quick sort learned in class. I worked it through in detail and copied it here. My strategy was:
- Sort the array
- then from the back, take element for element and build two numbers.

Time complexity is O(n Log(n)):
Sorting takes O(n log(n)). Looping is O(n).


Space complexity is O(n):
Sorting is inplace and takes no extra space, i.e. is O(1)
Build the result takes O(n) space since for each input number we need to store where it goes.
