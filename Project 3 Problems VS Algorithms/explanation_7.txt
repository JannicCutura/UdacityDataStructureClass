seemed similar like the other problem -- did I miss something here??

Time complexity is O(n) at worst for both find and insert since it could be just one long url with no "branches".
/sub/sub1/sub2/.../.subn

Space complexity is also O(n) at worst.

Both time and space complexity decrease dramatically if the page is more of a tree pattern, with prefixes ("higher level
directories") which repeat themselves.
